# YouTubeDownloader
## Terminal based YouTube video downloader and separate script that converts it into an mp4 file.
### This script uses the `pytube` and `ffmpeg-python` repositories and has a freeze.py file with `py2exe` build instructions. The program creates all the needed files but you still need to download FFmpeg for everything to work.

### Build

Use the `python freeze.py` command.
